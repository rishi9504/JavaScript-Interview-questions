Core JavaScript & Language Features
1. "Can you explain the differences between a JavaScript engine's handling of `async/await` versus Promises, and describe a situation where you'd choose one over the other? Please provide a practical example from your experience."

2. "Let's discuss JavaScript memory management. Could you describe how closures affect memory, and share a situation where you had to optimize code to prevent memory leaks?"

3. "In your experience with JavaScript modules, what strategies have you used to handle circular dependencies? Could you walk me through a specific challenge you faced and how you resolved it?"

Advanced Concepts & Architecture
4. "Could you explain your approach to implementing complex state management in large applications? What factors influence your choice between solutions like Redux, MobX, or native Context API?"

5. "How have you leveraged JavaScript generators and iterators in production applications? Please share a specific example where they provided significant benefits."

6. "Tell me about a time when you had to optimize the performance of a JavaScript-heavy application. What metrics did you use, and what specific techniques did you implement?"

Modern JavaScript & ECMAScript
7. "How has your approach to JavaScript development evolved with the introduction of features like optional chaining, nullish coalescing, and private class fields? Share specific examples of how these have improved your code."

8. "Could you explain how you've used JavaScript decorators in your projects? What challenges did you face during implementation?"

Testing & Debugging
9. "Describe your approach to testing JavaScript applications. How do you determine the right balance between unit, integration, and end-to-end tests? Share examples from your experience."

10. "Tell me about the most challenging JavaScript bug you've encountered. How did you identify the root cause, and what tools or techniques did you use to resolve it?"

Security & Best Practices
11. "What security vulnerabilities have you encountered in JavaScript applications, and how did you address them? Please provide specific examples of security measures you've implemented."

12. "How do you ensure type safety in large JavaScript projects? What has been your experience with TypeScript or Flow, and how has it affected your development process?"

Browser & Runtime Environment
13. "Could you explain how you've handled browser compatibility issues in your projects? Share an example of a complex cross-browser challenge you resolved."

14. "What's your experience with Service Workers and Progressive Web Apps? Describe a situation where you implemented offline functionality in a web application."

Real-World Problem Solving
15. "Can you describe a situation where you had to refactor a large legacy JavaScript codebase? What was your strategy, and how did you ensure the reliability of the refactored code?"
